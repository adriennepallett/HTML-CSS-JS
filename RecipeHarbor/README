Welcome to the RECIPE HARBOR WEBSITE README
This project was created as a part of a Interactive Web Developement course at Nova Southeastern University.
***************************************************************************************************************
The requirements from the professor:

Over the course of the semester, you will work on two main sites: one built in HTML, and one using Wordpress. 
The following assignment details the HTML Site assignment.

Most web sites are built on the foundation of HTML (hypertext markup language), with additional functionality being 
added through things like CSS (cascading style sheets), Javascript,  and third-party applications via APIs 
(application programming interfaces). To ensure that users can find sites via search engines, and access site content, 
sites must be organized and make use of standard conventions, but it is often not enough to simply present content in 
a modular way. Users expect sites to be attractive and media rich as well. 
To demonstrate your ability to design a professional web site, you will compose a real or spoof site 
that can be one of the following:

A professional non-profit organization site
A professional commercial site
Your site should include the following features:

Well-formed HTML
Responsive web design
A CSS-styled menu
Functionality based on Javascript
Functionality from a third-party API
Rich media and interactivity
You can code the various files from scratch, work from a template, and/or work within a framework such as W3.css, FlexBox, 
or Bootstrap. You are allowed to work from templates, but the template used should be disclosed as a comment in your 
HTML head, and substantial changes should be made to it that showcase your ability to develop beyond the template.

Your site files will be hosted in a folder on http://www.scmaker.site Links to an external site. and perhaps also on GitHub. 
Instructions for uploading files to our course server will be made available.
